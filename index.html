        <p>The ultimate goal of any software or SaaS product is to allow clients to seemlessly adopt the new product without interruption to the flow of their business. Good coding practices certainly help the product deliver results to a business. But, that is only one piece of the solution.</p>
        <p>Without good design, a well-written software product will fail to deliver to its fullest potential. If the interface is clumsy or difficult to use, then it really does not matter how efficient the code was written. Saving milliseconds by properly planning the design of the code's data structures will be meaningless if it takes the end-users hours to navigate the front-end of the product.</p>
        <p>That's why any organization looking to build a new application or web application needs to consider not just how the application runs, but how the people using the application will interact with it. Part of the application design process involves the process of working with the intention to make the code as efficient and secure as possible, while keeping the end-user in mind and how they will interact with the application.</p>
